# 🏦 German Credit Risk Analysis

An end-to-end machine learning project that analyzes and predicts credit risk using the German Credit Dataset. The objective is to help financial institutions assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan by building robust classification models and visualizing insights via Power BI dashboards.
